# Lynez - Made by Probots!

Our game is made using HTML5 CANVAS. It a mouse-only game, made for complete engagement through it's appealing visuals and beautiful animations.

The game makes use of sprites to animate the fireball and real life physics for collision handling.

# How to Run
Open index.html file. 

# How to Play 
Use the mouse to pin-point the location to which the line segment is being drawn. A pivot is fixed to help you.
Just click and play. If the ball hits the side - YOU LOSE! After each level, platforms are randomly generated to increase the difficulty.


**NOTE: THE COLLISIONS ONLY WORK WHEN BALL FALLS DOWNWARDS SO AS TO AVOID IT GETTING TRAPPED**

Best of luckðŸ¤ž ahead!
